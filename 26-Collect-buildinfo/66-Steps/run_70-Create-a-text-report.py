        ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

        General advice: Take a look at the BUILDINFO to
        see what happened. The buildinfo only changes when
        a new build is run.

        About output formats:

        HTML
        is the usual html output. Paths to static files for css,
        js, fonts are absolute so manuals on the server in general
        share the same static files.

        SINGLEHTML
        has everything in one html file.

        PDF
        is a pdf file generated from LaTeX.

        PACKAGE
        is a zip archive with the HTML output. It is well suited
        for offline reading since css and js files are included
        and paths are relative. If a PDF was generated that file
        is included too.

        BUILDINFO
        is a folder on the server with information about the last
        build.
